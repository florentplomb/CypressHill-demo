# CypressHill-demo

For my company during my free time, I designed and developed a custom app that streamlines the process of updating customer software. This app provides the following benefits:
- Demo : [Here](https://florentplomb.github.io/CypressHill-demo/)

- Simplified server maintenance: The app sends automated emails to customers, notifying them of scheduled maintenance, thus reducing the need for manual communication.

- Automated build and deployment: The app prepares build files and generates deployment commands programmatically, eliminating the possibility of human syntax errors and reducing the time and effort required for updates.

- End-to-end testing: The app includes end-to-end (E2E) testing capabilities to validate new features, ensuring a smoother and more reliable update process.
